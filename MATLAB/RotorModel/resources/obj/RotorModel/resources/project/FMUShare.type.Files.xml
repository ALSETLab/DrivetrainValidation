<Info Copyright="" Description="This FMU calculates the forces and moments produced by a typical small eVTOL rotor using Blade Element Theory and a Uniform Inflow Model. All Units are SI (mks).&#xa;&#xa;Inputs:&#xa;- Rotor Rotational Speed (1x1 Double)&#xa;- Rotor Linear Velocity (3x1 Double)&#xa;- Rotor Angular Velocity (3x1 Double)&#xa;- Rotor Radius (1x1 Double)&#xa;- Spin Direction (1x1 Boolean)&#xa;&#xa;The two velocity inputs are defined in a hub-attached reference frame, and represent the velocity of the rotor hub with respect to the air. X-axis is positive forward, Y-axis is positive toward the right, and Z-axis is positive down.&#xa;&#xa;The spin direction is 0 for counter-clockwise spin, 1 for clockwise spin&#xa;&#xa;The outputs are:&#xa;&#xa;- Rotor Forces (3x1 Double)&#xa;- Rotor Moment (3x1 Double)&#xa;&#xa;The forces and moments are evaluated at the rotor hub, and are defined in the same coordinate frame as the velocities (e.g. thrust is positive down)" License="" Author="Bob" MainInterface="Rotor.slx" />
